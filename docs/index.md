### 3.
The greatest thing about technical support is that one gets the opportunity to make the product as frictionless as possible. This could be through showing users how to use the product, show them a better way to use the product, and help discover and fix any issues that make using the product hard.

## Netlify/StaticGen

  This wasn't my first time using Netlify/StaticGen. As usual, the only problem was from determining what StaticGen template I would use.
  I am beginning to suspect that the ease of use of a template is related to the amount "circle" of dependency hell your chosen language takes you to
  in the OS you are using. This is because after struggling with dependency errors when I tried to use JavaScript templates (I use a Windows computer), I had the most straight-forward
  process when I decided to use a Python template.

  Installing and using MkDocs could only have been easier if it was a drag-and-drop editor (and maybe not even then).



## Documentation

My favorite technical product documentation is the Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/)) documentation. I love it because, unlike a lot of other product documentations, following the instructions ALWAYS work. At least I cannot remember an instance in which they did not A lot of the time, documentation seems to be written for an OS, product version, or even year other than the one you are using. Or live in. It can be frustrating that one had to spend a lot of time in forums looking for solutions after spending a lot of time going through the documentation. I know there are a lot of products I have not used in AWS, but for all of those I have, AWSâ€™ docs has always had my back in ways that Google Cloud, Heroku, GitHub Pages, GoDaddy, MongoDB, Node, Django, MySQL, etc never have. I think it is the one and only software/SaaS that I have learned how to use solely by reading the documentation.
