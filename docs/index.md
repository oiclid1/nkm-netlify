## Technical Support Activities

### 1. Favorite Technical Support Activities From List

* Debug a customer's build using a programming language and framework that you've never seen before.
* Set up your own copy of several static site frameworks for debugging.
* Work with people to figure out if Netlify's service can solve a particular workflow or integration challenge they have.
* Submit bug reports and potentially bug fixes to closed and open source projects that Netlify maintains on GitHub.
* Spot trends across many cases to improve Netlify's product and service.

### 2. Least favorite Technical Activities From List

* Deliver a talk to many people you don't know at a conference or meetup.
* Respond to Netlify customers on Twitter.
* Engage multiple users at once via chat to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems.
* Manage a Support team.
* Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case.

### 3.
The greatest thing about technical support is that one gets the opportunity to make the product as frictionless as possible. This could be through showing users how to use the product, show them a better way to use the product, and help discover and fix any issues that make using the product hard.

## Netlify/StaticGen

This wasn't my first time using Netlify/StaticGen. Once again, I was impressed with how easy it is to deploy to Netlify. As  I did not want to deal with JavaScript dependency hell, I decided to use a Python Site Generator. After playing around with a couple of SiteGens, I decided on MkDocs, for its simplicity and ease of use, as well as for the fact that it had a StaticGen "deploy" button.

 I have used a lot of hosting services before, but the only one that compare in terms of how easy it is to deploy a site would be GitHub Pages. But I love the fact that Netlify gives user a lot more control over what frameworks to use than GitHub Pages does.

## Documentation

My favorite technical product documentation is the Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/)) documentation. I love it because, unlike a lot of other product documentations, following the instructions ALWAYS work. At least I cannot remember an instance in which they did not A lot of the time, documentation seems to be written for an OS, product version, or even year other than the one you are using. Or live in. It can be frustrating that one had to spend a lot of time in forums looking for solutions after spending a lot of time going through the documentation. I know there are a lot of products I have not used in AWS, but for all of those I have, AWSâ€™ docs has always had my back in ways that Google Cloud, Heroku, GitHub Pages, GoDaddy, MongoDB, Node, Django, MySQL, etc never have. I think it is the one and only software/SaaS that I have learned how to use solely by reading the documentation.

## SSL/HTTPS

SSL/HTTPS provides a secure connection between the web host and the client. This is important because it:

    1. Encrypts all information being transferred across the connection. This makes it hard for anybody to easily eavesdrop on the connection. The user is assured that his/her sensitive information such as passwords, card numbers, etc, are secure and not easily stolen.
    2. It provides authentication, assuring the user that information is being sent to (and received from) the right servers, and not to imposters.
    3. It enable users to have greater trust that the websites they are transacting with is not an imposter, and that they are secure.

## DNS Challenges

Major challenges around DNS configuration are for less technical internet end-users include:
  1. Some elements seem to do the same thing. For instance A records and CNAMEs both seem to name servers.
  2. 

## Customer problem

First of all make sure that you did not run "build" before pushing your code to the git repo. Make sure your GitHub account is connected to your SiteGen account. Once that is done, push add and commit any changes you have made to your code, and then push the code to GitHub. Once that is done, simply run "netlify deploy". This would deploy your code to StaticGen. Repeat the process anytime you change your code to keep your website up-to-date.

To view your app's admin dashboard, log into your Netlify account and select the app you want to view. The view you would be presented with would give you various options, giving you full control of your app.

## Job Posting
 I loved the Netlify job posting, as it took time out to talk a little about the company, its history, business, and culture before talking to me about the position. Most job posts I've seen only talk about the company before going on to the job description and requirements. Nothing about their histories and culture.
